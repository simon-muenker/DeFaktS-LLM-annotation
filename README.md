## Questions

- Legal status of the full-text column: Can one publish full text, including the Twitter internal metrics, despite the Twitter/X guidelines?
- Can the DeFaktS team provide us with the original train/validation/test data splits to ensure comparable results?
- Does the fine-granular classification task include span detection?
